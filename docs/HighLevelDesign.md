# High-Level Design - Audio Noise Eraser

## 1. System Architecture

The Audio Noise Eraser is designed as a web application with a client-server architecture:

```
+---------------------+         +--------------------+          +--------------------+
|                     |         |                    |          |                    |
|  Client Application | <-----> |   Flask Backend    | <------> |  Neural Network    |
|  (React, Tailwind)  |  HTTP   |   (Python Flask)   |          |  Model (TensorFlow)|
|                     |  REST   |                    |          |                    |
+---------------------+         +--------------------+          +--------------------+
```

### Components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React-based web application
   - User interface for audio file upload/download
   - Audio visualization and comparison tools
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

2. **Backend Service**
   - Flask RESTful API
   - Audio processing endpoints
   - File handling and temporary storage
   - Model inference orchestration

3. **AI Processing Engine**
   - TensorFlow-based neural network model
   - Audio signal processing algorithms
   - Spectral analysis and reconstruction

## 2. Key Features

1. **Audio Upload and Processing**
   - Support for WAV and MP3 audio formats
   - Secure file handling and validation
   - Progress indicators for processing status

2. **Noise Reduction**
   - Deep learning-based noise identification
   - Spectral analysis using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
   - Phase-aware audio reconstruction

3. **Audio Visualization and Comparison**
   - Waveform visualization of original and processed audio
   - A/B comparison with slider interface
   - Before/after audio playback

4. **Result Delivery**
   - Processed audio file download
   - In-browser audio playback
   - Processing quality metrics

## 3. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: ShadCN UI library
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API

### Backend
- **API Framework**: Flask
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa, SoundFile
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow
- **Data Handling**: NumPy

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Flask development server (production would use Gunicorn)

## 4. System Interaction Flow

1. User uploads audio file through web interface
2. Frontend validates file format and sends to backend API
3. Backend saves file temporarily and initiates processing
4. Audio is transformed to frequency domain using STFT
5. Neural network model processes the spectral data
6. Processed data is reconstructed back to time domain
7. Resulting audio file is made available for download/playback
8. User can compare original and processed audio
9. User downloads the denoised audio file

## 5. Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Backend can be scaled with multiple containers
- **Processing Queue**: For high-volume scenarios, add message queue
- **Cache Layer**: Add caching for frequently accessed resources
- **Model Deployment**: Separate model serving for parallel processing
